.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Recoverjpeg
tries to identify jpeg pictures from a filesystem image. To achieve
this goal, it scans the filesystem image and looks for a jpeg structure at
blocks starting at 512 bytes boundaries.

Salvaged jpeg pictures are stored under the name \fIimageXXXXX.jpg\fP
where \fIXXXXX\fP is a five digit number starting at zero.

.SH KNOWN BUGS
.B Recoverjpeg
does not include a complete jpeg parser. You may need to use
sort-pictures afterwards to identify bogus pictures. Even in this case, jpeg
pictures may be corrupted but have a correct structure; in this case, parts
of the picture may be garbled.
