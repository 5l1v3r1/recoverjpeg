Installation
------------
To install recoverjpeg, as root run

  ./configure && make install

To use sort-pictures, you need to install:

  - exif: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libexif
  - ImageMagick: http://www.imagemagick.org/

Usage
-----
Look at the manual pages for recoverjpeg(1) and sort-pictures(1).

History
-------
recoverjpeg was written on 23 December 2004 after a *huge* mistake:
a disk containing pictures was repartitioned and a new operating
system was installed on top. recoverjpeg and sort-pictures ran on this
80GB disk and retrieved 11GB worth of pictures:

  - 9398 pictures sorted by date (a few of them were corrupted)

  - 1539 JFIF files without date (some of them were correct pictures
    whose exif data had been corrupted)

  - 6810 JFIF files too small to be digital pictures (no error there,
    most of them were thumbnails of real pictures)

  - 92 invalid JFIF files

Of course, I had a backup of everything, but I cannot seem to remember
where I put it.

Portability
-----------
recoverjpeg has been tested on a FreeBSD 5.3-STABLE on ix86 and on
Debian 3.1 on ix86 (2.6.9 kernel) and UltraSparc (2.4.21 kernel) platforms.

You need to ensure that the off_t type from the C library and the
mmap() functions support offsets of at least the size of the device
you want to recover pictures from.
